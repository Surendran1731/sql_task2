I recently completed the Guvi-Zen class Roadmap Database: Day-2 Task. During this task, I delved into various MySQL queries, gaining a deeper understanding of relational database operations. Additionally, I honed my skills in designing an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Diagram using MySQL Workbench, further solidifying my grasp of database design concepts.
